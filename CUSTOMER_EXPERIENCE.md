One click to copy/send response
```

### 6️⃣ **What Makes It Valuable**

- Copy/edit AI replies = 10 minutes
- Total: 15 minutes daily
- **Saves 65+ minutes every day!**

## 🎯 The Magic: How It Actually Works

### Behind the Scenes:

1. **Email Sync**
   ```
   Customer grants Gmail access
      ↓
   App fetches unread emails (last 7 days)
      ↓
   Stores email metadata (not full content)
   ```

2. **AI Processing**
   ```
   Email batch sent to Claude AI
      ↓
   Claude analyzes each email for:
   - Key points (2-sentence summary)
   - Urgency level (priority)
   - Category (work/personal/etc)
   - Suggested response (if needed)
      ↓
   Results saved to database
   ```

3. **Dashboard Display**
   ```
   Customer opens dashboard
      ↓
   Sees processed emails with:
   - Color-coded priorities
   - Quick summaries
   - One-click actions
   ```
